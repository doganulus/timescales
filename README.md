## timescales

`timescales` is a benchmark generator for Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) monitoring tools. It is originally developed for the monitoring tool [Reelay](https://github.com/doganulus/reelay) but distributed standalone. It generates an MTL specification (as a standard YAML file) and an input trace (as a standard CSV file) that satisfies the formula at every time point. For the benchmark generation, a set of predefined timed properties are available through the interface. Please see the help and documentation for more information.

The purpose of these benchmarks is to measure the performance and scalability of MTL monitoring tools with respect to large timing bounds in the specification over some typical cases. Ideally, the performance of real-time monitoring tools should remain constant when the base time unit has changed. This is due to that different (parts of) systems use different time scales up to orders of magnitude and the specification of slower systems contain large timing bounds.

## Use

The generator `timescales` includes a Makefile to demonstrate the generation of benchmarks. For each supported property, the command `make small` generates a benchmark that contains a specification with small timing bounds and a short trace. On the other hand, the command `make large` generates three benchmarks for each property with increasingly larger time bounds (1x, 10x, 100x) over traces with a length of 1 million. The large suite has a size of 400MB and is not included in the distribution. Finally the command `make full` extends the large suite by dense time behaviors. The large suite has a size of 550MB and is not included in the distribution. Besides these default benchkmark suites, the customization of benchmark generation can be done easily using the command line interface of `timescales`.
